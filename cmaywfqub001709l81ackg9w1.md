**1/12 ðŸš€ Google I/O 2025 just wrapped â€” and it was a full-throttle showcase of AI in everything.**

From smarter Search to Gemini 2.5, 3D video calls, and AR smart glasses â€” hereâ€™s what actually matters (no fluff, just the future) ðŸ§µ

#GoogleIO2025

**2/12** Google Search now has "AI Mode" (live in US). You can ask complex questions and get detailed, fact-checked answers. It breaks down your question into parts and double-checks itself. Way smarter than regular search.

**3/12** Meet Gemini 2.5 Pro - Google's smartest AI yet. It has "Deep Think" mode that considers multiple answers before responding. Perfect for math, coding, and tough questions. Also released Gemini 2.5 Flash for faster everyday tasks.

**4/12** Two new AI subscriptions: â€¢ AI Pro: $19.99/month (early access + higher limits) â€¢ AI Ultra: $249.99/month (Deep Think, video creation, 30TB storage) Ultra is US-only for now and yeah, it's expensive.

**5/12** Android XR smart glasses are back! These AR/VR glasses show messages, photos, and directions right in your vision, powered by Gemini AI. Think Google Glass but actually useful this time.

**6/12** "Beam" is their new 3D video calling platform using multiple cameras and AI to create lifelike calls. Plus Veo 3 now generates audio with videos, and Flow does AI video editing. Video tech is getting wild.

**7/12** Shopping got an AI upgrade. Upload your photo to virtually try on clothes - AI simulates how fabric moves on your body. AI assistants also track prices and availability. Online shopping just got more interactive.

**8/12** Gmail is learning your writing style from past emails and Drive files to suggest personalized replies. Coming this summer for subscribers. Finally, smart replies that actually sound like you.

**9/12** For developers: Google AI Studio lets you prototype with Gemini API, and "Jules" is an AI coding agent that can read, write, and debug code autonomously in your repos. AI is coming for coding too.

**10/12** Gemini now has natural voice output with adjustable tone and style. It can even switch languages mid-conversation. AI conversations are getting more human-like.

**11/12** Better security with new anti-scam protections and improved tools to find lost Android devices. Someone's thinking about keeping us safe in this AI world.

**12/12** The numbers: 1.5B people use AI Overviews monthly, 400M+ use Gemini app. Google's bet is clear - AI everywhere, in everything. The future is here, and it's powered by AI.
